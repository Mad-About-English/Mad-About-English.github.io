              As soon as I could read on my own, I developed a mad passion for
              the English Language. Hence, I thought, what better way to indulge
              this passion than to intrigue young minds and ignite in them a
              similar love? Over the course of my 23 years as an English
              language educator, I taught in mainstream schools before crossing
              over to the private education sector where I found my niche.

            <b>MOE experience</b>
            <p>
              In the 7 years I spent at MOE, I taught General Paper and
              Literature at a junior college, had a stint as a literature
              curriculum officer at the Gifted Education Branch, and taught a
              class of graduating students at a secondary school.
            </p>
            <b>Private Education experience</b>
            <p>
              Besides teaching at 3 top enrichment centres, I also headed the
              Primary English department in two of them. During this time, I
              picked up many pedagogical approaches as well as found deep
              satisfaction in crafting teaching materials that would excite all
              students who walked into the classroom.
